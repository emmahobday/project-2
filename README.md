## Weather API

## Overview

This was a two-day paired project as part of the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly London. 

The assignment was to build a React application that consumes a public API.

We chose to create a weather forecasting app, using DarkSky API. 

You can view the app on GitHub pages [here](https://emmahobday.github.io/project-2/), and find the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/emmahobday/project-2).

## Brief

* Consume a public API
* Have several components - at least one classical and one functional
* The app should include a router with several 'pages'
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
* Include wireframes that you designed before building the app
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public
* Have semantically clean HTML

## Technologies used
* HTML5
* React
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6)
* Git and GitHub
* Google Fonts
* NPM


## Approach

// the general approach we took
- summarise the components of our app and how they interact
- which elements are hard-coded and which come from API, and why
- UX - layout and info included 

// installation instruction for any dependencies


// link to wireframes -sketches of major views/interfaces
- ??

// description of any unsolved problems or major hurdles your team had to overcome 
- clock
- CORS issues with API
